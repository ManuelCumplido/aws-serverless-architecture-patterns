# AWS Serverless Architecture Patterns

This repository is a continuously evolving collection of architecture patterns, design notes, and system-level insights related to building serverless systems in AWS.

It captures practical learnings across multiple AWS services as they are explored, implemented, and analyzed over time.

Rather than focusing on a single service, this repository documents how different services interact within distributed cloud-native systems.


## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Document architectural decisions
- Capture design trade-offs
- Record implementation patterns
- Analyze scalability and reliability considerations
- Reflect on real-world engineering lessons

This is not a service-by-service documentation repository.
It is a systems-thinking notebook focused on architecture.

## 🏗 Areas of Exploration

As the repository evolves, it may include notes and patterns related to:

- Data modeling strategies
- Messaging and event-driven systems
- Observability and monitoring
- Failure handling and resilience
- Cost-aware design
- Infrastructure as Code
- Performance optimization
- Cross-service integrations

New modules are added progressively as deeper exploration occurs.

## 📈 Philosophy

Serverless systems simplify infrastructure management,
but they increase the importance of architecture decisions.

This repository aims to document those decisions with clarity and technical depth.
